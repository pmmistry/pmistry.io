# Reflecting on Challenges, Changes and Growth in 2020
2020 has been a year of immense challenges, changes, and growth. One of the biggest challenges and changes that we overcame as a developer advocacy team was pivoting from in-person events to 100 percent digital! 

Although making this pivot felt apprehensive at first, we were surprised by the many different growth opportunities. 

- Our audience and our reach was now worldwide, whereas before, our geo-locations bounded us 
- There were countless opportunities for collaboration with different teams and subject matter experts
- We were able to create more content that can turn into a series 
- Most importantly, our content is documented and recorded for our audience to reference

Most of our advocacy last year happened through our [Crowdcast channel](https://www.crowdcast.io/ibmdeveloper).

Anyone who follows us has access to hundreds of webinars and series on topics ranging from AI/ML, Data Science, Cloud Computing, Serverless, Web development, Java, Quantum and many more hosted and taught by IBM developer advocates from around the world. 

As an IBM Developer advocate, content producer, and educator, here are some of â€¦.

In July, I was able to host Doug McClure, a Research Staff Member and Manager of Quantum System Deployment at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, to introduce basic ideas in quantum computing, survey state of the art in building real quantum computers, and provide a hands-on introduction to the Qiskit programming language for building and running quantum algorithms.

In August, I created a workshop on getting started with the Watson SDK. There are over ten different unique services on the IBM Cloud that are free for developers to use with the lite account. Services such as assistant, speech to text, text to speech, discovery, visual recognition, tone analyzer, natural language processing, and language translator, to name a few, provide unique insights for developers to use in their applications.

Throughout the summer, IBM launched the Emb(race) [Call for Code for Racial Justice Challenge](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/racial-justice/) to combat systemic racism. Focusing on Police & Judicial Reform and Accountability, Diverse Representation, and Policy & Legislation Reform, we are formed open source projects to help combat discrimination and promote racial justice. We invited people across the globe to channel their frustrations about systemic racism tangibly and authentically by getting involved with these projects and making an impact in communities. 

Check out our GitHub and submit pull requests and issues work with our opensource project around **Police & Judicial Reform, Diverse Representation, Policy & Legislation Reform:** [https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code](https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code)

## Conclusion 

Although 2020 was challenging in so many ways, I am grateful that technology has allowed me to work on so many different ideas and collaborate with so many amazing people world wide! 

I hope you find some of my highlights and resources interesting as you go through your technical journey. I plan to keep creating and sharing content and topics with you throughout 2021! 

Aside from the content I have produced this year, we have hundreds of different webinars on numerous topics; all hosted on our Crowdcast channel made by IBM developer advocates from around the world!
